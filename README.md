I have made a ecommerce website using react.js and material UI
I have used the functionality in 'add to cart' when user clicked on this button, numbers will be showed on the cart-icons and when user 
clicked on the cart-icon it will directly take you the /cart where users can see the selected items and they can set accordingly wheather
they want to increase, decrease and remove the selected item, with the increasing,decreasing total cost will also work accordingly. 
When user increase the selected item total cost will increase and when user wanted to decrease that particular item then total cost will reduce.
Also made a shipping and payment details with submit button wrapped in the card tag where user clicked the submit it will display order is placed.
And when there is not items in the cart then it will display 'cart is empty' and also display the button 'back to main page' where user can reach to the home page.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
